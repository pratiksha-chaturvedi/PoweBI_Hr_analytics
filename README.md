# PoweBI_Hr_analytics
The project involves the creation of a comprehensive HR analytics database focused on 
attrition. The primary objective is to centralize and organize HR data to gain valuable insights 
into the factors contributing to attrition within the organization, enabling data-driven 
decision-making and targeted retention strategies. The database will serve as a critical tool for 
HR professionals and organizational leaders to proactively address attrition, improve 
employee satisfaction, and reduce turnover.
